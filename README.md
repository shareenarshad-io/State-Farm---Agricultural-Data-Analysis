# State-Farm---Agricultural-Data-Analysis
State Farm Data Science Project

The objective of this project is to provide actionable insights into optimal crop selection by analyzing environmental and soil factors. This will involve an exploration of how various crops respond to specific conditions, such as soil nutrient content, climatic factors like temperature and humidity, and rainfall patterns.

The analysis should consider the full spectrum of agricultural conditions represented in the dataset. Insights derived from this study are expected to guide farmers in selecting the most suitable crops based on their specific environmental conditions.
